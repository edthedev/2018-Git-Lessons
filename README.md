Introductory Git lessons

# Git Lab



## Lesson Plan

Bare minimums
  - Installing Git, VSCode and PowerShell 6
  - Git init
  - Commit all
  - Revert all


Offsite backup
  - make a remote
  - Add a remote
  - delete all local files
  - restore from remote
  - Change remotes?
  - use two remotes?

Tragedy Undone 1: Restore from remote
TU2: Revert an old mistake
TU: go back in time and try something v different - checkout from history, make a branch
TU: keep the best of both timelines - checkout first branch, revert a mistake, switch back, rebase, merge


Taking a breather \ changing course
  - git stash
  - git branch

Collaborating
  - fetch, pull and rebase
  - code review
